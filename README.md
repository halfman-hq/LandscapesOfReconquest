# LandscapesOfReconquest

Landscapes of (Re)Conquest is a journey though the history of the Iberian Peninsula from AD 711 to 1492 using augmented reality. The visitor will be able to view and interact with an immersive technology timeline showing them what the past looked like during this tumultuous period of transition from Muslim to Christian rule. The experience will show the visitor how life, politics and agriculture worked visually, but will also act as a guide in exploring the local wine and food production which reflect this history.
