    <h1>Landscapes of Reconquest</h4>
        <p>Landscapes of (Re)Conquest is a journey though the history of the Iberian Peninsula from AD 711 to 1492 using augmented reality. The visitor will be able to view and interact with an immersive technology timeline showing them what the past looked like during this tumultuous period of transition from Muslim to Christian rule. The experience will show the visitor how life, politics and agriculture worked visually, but will also act as a guide in exploring the local wine and food production which reflect this history.</p>
        <p>The interdisciplinary team for Landscapes of (Re)Conquest, of which Halfman is a member, consists of interaction designers, software developers, archeologists, museum curators, historical content creators and archivists, tour guides and wine experts partnering with regional governments in Spain and The University of Reading.</p>
